To design a **Home Assistant (Hass.io)** setup on **K3S (Lightweight Kubernetes)**, 
I'll walk you through a typical setup architecture and key considerations. 
Here's an overview of what the system might look like, followed by a detailed breakdown of each component:

### Overview of Design

1. **K3S Cluster**
   - **Master Node and Workers **: Central control plane that runs the API server, etcd (key-value store), scheduler, and controller manager.

2. **Home Assistant (Hass.io)**
   - **Containerized Deployment**: Home Assistant is deployed as a container inside the K3S cluster, taking advantage of Kubernetes' resource management and scaling.
   
3. **Persistent Storage** (for Home Assistant and Add-ons)
   - Use **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** to ensure that important data such as Home Assistant configurations, logs, and database data are stored persistently and survive pod restarts.

4. **Add-ons containers**
   - **MQTT Broker** (e.g., Mosquitto) for IoT 
   - **cloudflared** as container connected to traefik ingress controler

6. **Automation & Backup**:
   - Use **CronJobs** to backup hassio PVC that content

### Step-by-Step Design Process

#### 1. **K3S Setup**
   - Install K3S on your master node:
     ```bash
     curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
     ```

#### 2. **Helm**
